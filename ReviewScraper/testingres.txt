Review: We had a great time painting at Katie's Clay Studio for a baby shower. We had a choice of a plate, a mug, or a bowl. She then finishes them with a glaze and you pick your piece up a week later. She also has a wide variety of ceramics to paint for other customers.

Response from the owner 2 years ago
Hi Jennifer, we‚Äôre sorry to hear that you were unsatisfied with experience at our studio. As a full-service studio, we strive for superior customer service and to give our full attention to each patron while they create with us. Unfortunately, it sounds like you visited us on a very busy day when that was a little harder to accomplish. We would love another chance to earn your business and show you the personal attention each of our customers deserve. As always, we encourage you to take advantage of our friendly staff as they circulate, and please don‚Äôt hesitate to request more assistance should you need it the next time you visit us.
