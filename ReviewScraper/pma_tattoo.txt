Review: The owner Sara is who I worked with. She's very professional and just lovely. I felt very taken care of. She made sure the tattoo was well planned and she asked me several questions and made suggestions that made this tattoo exactly what I wanted. The shop is beautiful and seems to be very clean. Would recommend this place! ❤️

Sorry to hear you were not happy with your experience. We have never had a one star review before and have reached out but still haven't heard back as to why. We see that you were on the schedule two years ago, but we didn't tattoo you possibly due to violation of the deposit policy which we had emailed to you prior to you paying the deposit. Deposit policies are in place to protect artists and clients alike and can be found on our website under 'what to expect'. Sorry to hear this was upsetting, however this is why we send out and review deposit policies to clients prior to them paying it. The form states that clients are welcome to ask questions before paying to make certain we are on the same page before any money is put down on an appointment. Hope you are well!
